# Russian Roulette
## 📝 Project Description
### "Russian Roulette" is a simple game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The player is presented with buttons (squares), some of which are safe, while others can lead to the end of the game. The game includes two modes:

- Standard Mode: In the event of a loss, the computer will shut down.
- Kid Mode: A safe mode where the game ends without shutting down the computer.

## 🎮 Key Features:
- 10 buttons: 6 are safe and 4 are dangerous.
- A slider to toggle between standard and kid mode.
- Modern dark-themed interface.
- Automatic game completion once all safe squares are found.
- Losing in standard mode will shut down the computer.
- Kid mode ensures the game ends without shutting down the system.
